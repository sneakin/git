git-notes(1)
============

NAME
----
git-notes - Add/inspect commit notes

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git-notes' (edit | show) [commit]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This command allows you to add notes to commit messages, without
changing the commit.  To discern these notes from the message stored
in the commit object, the notes are indented like the message, after
an unindented line saying "Notes:".

To disable commit notes, you have to set the config variable
core.notesRef to the empty string.  Alternatively, you can set it
to a different ref, something like "refs/notes/bugzilla".  This setting
can be overridden by the environment variable "GIT_NOTES_REF".


SUBCOMMANDS
-----------

edit::
	Edit the notes for a given commit (defaults to HEAD).

show::
	Show the notes for a given commit (defaults to HEAD).
